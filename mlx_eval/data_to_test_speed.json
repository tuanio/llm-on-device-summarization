A staff member in Doyle's Washington D.C. office opened a letter containing a grainy white substance and immediately alerted Capitol police. The tests of the substance came back negative and the quarantine of Room 239 of the Cannon House Office building was removed at 3:37 p.m. on Wednesday, reports Triblive. Temporary shutdown: Capitol Police secure as officers begin to remove hazmat suits in a hallway in the Cannon House Office Building after a suspicious powder was discovered on Wednesday . A powdery white substance was found in the office of Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills (pictured) but it was found to be a non-harmful substance . The congressman said that the Capitol police were 'prompt and professional.' The white substance was cause for concern after powdered anthrax was mailed to members of congress in 2001 following the September 11 attacks. After testing, assistant who opened the envelope was not advised to seek medical attention and was simply told to wash her hands. Doyle was concerned for the well-being of his staffer but remained calm throughout the ordeal and maintained a sense of humor. 'I’m sure they won’t forget their visit,' Doyle said of the four visitors under lockdown in his office along with his staff. 'I live in Pittsburgh. We’re not afraid of anything,' Doyle joked, according to the Hill Blotter. 'All clear with nothing hazardous found. The area has been reopened,' department spokesman Shennell Antrobus said in an email. The testing lasted just under two hours. The substance has not yet been identified and neither has its sender but an investigation is ongoing.

    "article": "(CNN)Pushed to his limits, a college professor took the extreme measure of threatening to fail his entire class. In an email to his students, Irwin Horwitz accused them of \"backstabbing, game playing, cheating, lying, fighting.\" The professor at the Texas A&M University Galveston Campus expected his missive would create some conflict, but that it could then be resolved quickly -- and quietly. Those hopes were dashed when one report by local media mushroomed into a tornado of nationwide coverage. The story went viral. Suddenly, his name was spreading on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, accompanied by the kind of strong, unvarnished opinions that you can make about people you've never met. He was a hero who taught today's entitled youth a much-needed lesson, or an egotistical nightmare of a teacher who threw a fit. One thing was certain: He, and his employer, were now thrust into a spotlight that neither had asked for. \"I did what I did without any intention of seeing this in the news or seeing this on the Internet,\" Horwitz said. \"I will stand by what I did, but I'm not career suicidal.\" Texas A&M says Horwitz remains an employee and that no one has asked him to stop teaching. But Horwitz, a nontenure-track professor in the maritime administration program, is afraid the notoriety will cost him this job and future jobs. Horwitz said his intent was not to be controversial, and the sharply worded email to students was not his first about the class. The day before writing to his students, Horwitz wrote a similar email to the CEO of the Texas A&M Galveston Campus and to the school's chief academic officer. \"I have never in my capacity as an academic ever encountered a class as completely disgraceful, dishonest and disrespectful\" as his current strategic management class, he wrote to the administrators. He accused the students of shirking responsibility, making excuses and complaining their way to better grades. He would no longer teach the course and would fail the entire class, Horwitz wrote. \"The class of graduating seniors is nothing more than a circus that is anything but academic,\" he wrote. \"But they are your problem now.\" It was the next day that Horwitz wrote to the students, calling the class \"an embarrassment in general,\" and said that \"I am frankly and completely disgusted.\" Once his words echoed in traditional and social media, the narrative -- angry prof flunks entire class -- might as well have been set in stone. The story was such a talker that even The Onion offered a parody. \"I'm not looking to fail students,\" Horwitz said. \"I don't get a bonus for failing students.\" \"The letter sounded a little bit more definite than I wanted it to,\" he added. He never actually changed anyone's grade. There were some students he wasn't going to fail, he said, and some who were on the border who could have pulled themselves out. But Horwitz stands by his tough stance; there was an issue of competency and of professionalism that had to be addressed, he said. The course in question is a capstone course for a maritime administration degree and is supposed to merge what the students learned in their other business courses. \"I had a large majority of people taking the capstone course who could not do a break-even analysis,\" the professor said. \"If you cannot do a break-even analysis, then you don't deserve a bachelor's degree in business.\" His other complaint was about professionalism. Horwitz said students would swear at him, cheat and spread rumors about him online. This is related to their grades, he said, because dealing with people you don't like is a business skill. On online message boards, users claiming to be students in the class accused the professor of exaggerating the situation or fabricating parts of his story. One purported student called Horwitz \"a little obnoxious,\" but said he is a good teacher and fair if you follow his rules. Should the professor have been surprised that his email went viral? The fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public, but maybe there is more to it. The situation hits on a popular argument on the media and Internet: What do we think of millennials? Reflecting on his most recent class, Horwitz said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered. He mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics, and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration. The other factor is a failure of K-12 education, said Horwitz, who has met college students who don't know how to convert fractions to decimals. \"What I'm trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance,\" he said. In a statement, Patrick Louchouarn, the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at Texas A&M Galveston Campus, said the entire class will not be failed. \"Each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester,\" Louchouarn said. \"The university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies.\" The flurry of attention is unwelcome and Horwitz fears it will affect his career in academia. But it's likely his story will have a short shelf life. People probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline. But he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere. He said he feels a public shaming of sorts. Online public shaming has become a research topic of its own. People who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance. \"This is really destroying my life,\" Horwitz said.",

    "article": "Six hostages who hid in a supermarket freezer during January's Islamist attacks in Paris have sued French media for broadcasting their location live during the siege. Amedy Coulibaly stormed into the Hyper Cacher Jewish store, killing four and taking others captive before being shot dead in a hail of gunfire by French special forces. The heavily televised events in eastern Paris came two days after Cherif and Said Kouachi shot 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Patrick Klugman, a lawyer representing the six survivors, said images broadcast from Hyper Cacher on January 9 'lacked the most basic precautions' and endangered those still alive inside. Scroll down for video . Police storm the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket, killing an Islamist terrorist in hail of gunfire. Six hostages who hid in a  freezer during the Islamist attacks have sued French media for broadcasting their location live . Terrorist: Amedy Coulibaly slaughtered customers during the siege at the Hyper Cacher store. Lawyers claim French media endangered the lives of hostages hiding a freezer by revealing their location live on air . He singled out French 24-hour news channel BFMTV which revealed live on air that the group - including a three-year-old child and a one-month-old baby - was hiding  in the freezer. They had been taken to the cold room by one of the supermarket's employees. 'The working methods of media in real time in this type of situation were tantamount to goading someone to commit a crime,' Mr Klugman told AFP Thursday, roundly criticising coverage by other outlets of the movements by security forces during the standoff. The lives of those hiding 'could have been at risk if Coulibaly had been aware in real time what BFMTV was broadcasting,' Klugman said. He added that the jihadist was following the coverage of his raid on different channels and had been in contact with BFMTV journalists. The lawsuit charges media  with endangering the lives of others by deliberately ignoring security protocols, which carries a maximum penalty of a year in prison and a €15,000 (£11,000) fine. Extraordinary pictures emerged in the days after the siege showing the hostage huddled together for warmth amid cardboard boxes of food inside the freezer. Defying terror: Hyper Cacher reopened last month with a vow to 'show that life is stronger than barbarity' One woman is seen cradling her child, while in another image a hostage sends a text message to a loved one. Hearing shots, shoppers at the back of the store fled downstairs to the storeroom where they huddled together in temperatures of -3C (27F). Fearing they would not escape alive, they made what they believed would be their last calls to family to tell them they loved them. One man, known only as Ilan, was with his young son and quickly removed his jacket and wrapped him in it as they cowered in freezer for nearly five hours before Coulibaly was shot dead. The Kouachi brothers were also killed after three days of attacks that killed a total of 17 people and deeply shocked France and the world. Hyper Cacher finally reopened last month with a vow to 'show that life is stronger than barbarity'.",

    "article": "A furious row erupted today between the Lib Dems and Conservatives over claims David Cameron is plotting to 'slash support for families'. Lib Dem minister Danny Alexander released details of what he claimed are secret plans drawn up in the last government to cut Child Benefit and Child Tax Credits. The Prime Minister 'flatly rejected' the plans, claiming they were drawn up by civil servants on the orders of Mr Alexander. But the Lib Dems hit back, claiming Mr Cameron himself had asked officials to examine ways to curb access to benefits. David Cameron, campaigning in Wetherby, West Yorkshire today, has hit back at claims the Tories have a secret plan to cut child benefit . Conservatives angrily denied the specific proposals set out in the document revealed by the Lib Dems but they remain under pressure to spell out how they will making savings from the benefits bill. According to Danny Alexander, the unimplemented Tory proposals included: . The clash is the worst row between the two former coalition partners and will raise serious doubts about whether they could work together again, if the Tories fall short of a majority. Conservatives angrily denied the specific proposals set out in the document revealed by Mr Alexander. But they remain under pressure to spell out how they will making savings from the benefits bill. Tory Chancellor George Osborne has promised to cut £12billion from the welfare bill after the election, but has repeatedly refused to say where the axe will fall. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg expressed outrage that the Tories could not be 'bothered' to come clean about their plans. The Lib Dems have vowed to block the plan as the price of any future coalition deal after May 7. Mr Alexander, who served as Chief Secretary for the Treasury, has now released details of benefit cuts put to the Quad of senior ministers, which included him, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Osborne. He said he was lifting the lid on the internal coalition discussions because his former government colleagues were 'trying to con the British people by keeping their planned cuts secret until after the election'. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg told LBC's Nick Ferrari that he backed Mr Alexander's decision to disclose details of confidential coalition discussions . Vince Cable has claimed the Tories have a 'nasty streak' as he warned workers had been hit hard by the coalition he served in. The Business Secretary claimed the Conservatives would resurrect plans to allow bosses to 'fire at will'. He told The Independent: 'They have an unfinished agenda. 'There is a very nasty streak [in the Conservative Party]. They are not all nasty as individuals. 'I have worked with them for five years. Some of them are perfectly decent, moderate people.' But he warned the Tories would 'chisel away' at workers' rights. The Lib Dems revealed that in June 2012, the Quad was sent a document called 'Welfare Reform Quad Summer Reading Pack' produced by officials working for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Mr Alexander said the previously dropped plans - including limiting Child Benefit and Child Tax Credit to two children at a cost of £3,500 for a family of three - were a clear signal of where the axe would fall. But he was forced to admit that many of the claims set out in today's document had been made public - and rejected by the Tories - in the past. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'There are lots of ideas that have been doing the rounds for years, so I think it's not credible for the Conservatives to say they do not know what they're going to do. 'If they are proposing £12billion of welfare savings without knowing what they're going to do, that is highly reckless. 'Equally, if they do know what they want to do and they're not telling the British people, that is deceitful. 'And that does frustrate me because I think that this is one of the issues that in the last seven days of the election campaign people would expect the Conservatives to come clean about.' Mr Clegg  backed Mr Alexander's decision to disclose details of confidential coalition discussions saying the Conservatives needed to say where their planned benefits cuts would fall. 'I share Danny's intense frustration verging on anger that the Conservatives think it is okay a week before an election to say that they are going to take the equivalent of £1,500 off eight million of the most vulnerable families in this country and they can't even be bothered to spell out exactly what their plans involve,' he said on an LBC radio phone-in. But the Conservatives dismissed the claim as 'desperate stuff' from the Liberal Democrats and insisted the proposals were 'definitely not our policy'. Mr Osborne told BBC London: 'Well this is a three year old document of policy options that was commissioned by the chief secretary himself. 'We have not put into practice any of these options. We don't support them. We didn't support them. We don't support them in the future.' Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured in Dewsbury today, said the future of child benefit and tax credits is 'on the ballot paper next week' David Cameron will today pledge to cut taxes for the young as he warns Labour would 'reach into your pay packet' by raising them. Young people have been the biggest winners from the increases in the personal allowance since 2010, according to new figures, with five million under-30s gaining an average of £70 a month each from being taken out of income tax. A further 500,000 will gain from the extension of the policy after the election. The announcement is part of a wider offer to young voters today. This includes a target to cut youth unemployment to the lowest level in the G7 group of nations. With just a week to go until polling stations open across the UK on May 7, Mr Cameron told the Guardian it was 'time to throw caution to the winds, let rip and tell people what you really think'. The Prime Minister - who has in recent days deployed a more energetic approach after criticism of a lacklustre pitch to the electorate - said: 'I think we will get there. But the reason it is taking time is, quite rightly, people want to have a good look and a good think.' Tory Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: 'This is just a desperate attempt by the Lib Dems to try to move their position in the polls, but it's not going to work because these proposals were never proposed or supported by the Prime Minister or the Chancellor and they would never be supported by the Prime Minister or the Chancellor. 'Our principles are very clear when it comes to welfare: it is there to help people, especially to help people get back into work, but also to support the disabled, to support pensioners - and those principles will not change.' Mr Alexander's revelations came as The Times reported growing dissent in Lib Dem ranks over the possibility of entering a second power-sharing deal with the Conservatives if the General Election fails to produce a clear winner. Nick Clegg has based his campaign around the premise that his party would be a restraining influence on either of the main parties. But the newspaper said a number of - mostly unnamed - parliamentarians were increasingly hostile to the prospect of a Tory tie-up, which would have to be approved by a special party conference. Mr Alexander said: 'For five years I won battle after battle to stop the Tories veering off to the right with ideological cuts, and it's been worth it to get the economy back on track while ensuring a fairer society. 'The coalition has delivered savings in a fair way, but the Tories now want to balance the books off the backs of ordinary working families and the most vulnerable in society. 'The Tories have turned their backs on the plan delivered in coalition government. Instead they want to cut £1,500 for eight million households, singling out middle and low-income families to bear the burden - and asking nothing from the best off. 'It's clear from our time in government that the Tories' target will be slashing support for families. I'm lifting the lid on this now because the Conservatives are trying to con the British people by keeping their planned cuts secret until after the election. 'They now ask the British people to trust them when they make unfunded pledges on health and tax, yet won't tell us how they will cut welfare for millions of families to pay for their plans. They may give with one hand, but they will take away twice as much with the other. 'The Liberal Democrats will take a fairer approach, cutting less than the Conservatives and borrowing less than Labour, to deliver a stronger economy and fairer society with opportunity for everyone.' Labour leader Ed Miliband also seized on the revelation.Speaking ahead of an event in Yorkshire, he said: 'Today we've learnt that child benefit and tax credits are on the ballot paper next week. 'The Tories have drawn up plans to take thousands of pounds away from millions of families. 'The Tories' secret plan has been revealed. 'And they will put it into practice in just seven days' time if they get the chance. 'It's the final proof that working families can't afford five years of the Tories.‎' CONSERVATIVES . LABOUR .

    "article": "The women who broke free from Cleveland's 'house of horrors' after a decade in captivity have revealed for the first time in their own words how they survived the traumatic ordeal. Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus recalled the years of rapes, torture and psychological games at the hands of Ariel Castro, a man who lived close to their homes in Ohio, and managed to lure them into his house with trust because his daughters were the girls' friends. The brave survivors have written a book, Hope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland, which will be released on April 27. In an excerpt, published in People magazine this week, Amanda and Gina, revealed how they found the strength to survive imprisonment. Scroll down for video . Amanda Berry, pictured following her escape from Ariel Castro's 'house of horrors' with her sister (left) and daughter (right) in 2013. The survivor has described in her new memoir, how her daughter gave her the strength to go on during the harrowing ten-year ordeal . Amanda Berry, 29, revealed in her first-person memoir about her abduction and imprisonment by Ariel Castro, that she was left confused by conflicted feelings towards him when he was kind to their daughter, whom she gave birth in captivity after being raped . Gina DeJesus, 25, also shared the details of her horrifying ordeal in a new memoir with Amanda Berry, being published later this week . Amanda recalled how she had learned from TV news that her mother died of a heart attack, aged 43, in March 2006, while she was 'chained like a dog' in Castro's home. At this point, the teen had been missing for three years. Castro lured her into his home on April 21, 2003, on a promise to see his daughter, her acquaintance. He barricaded the 16-year-old in a room, told her to pull down her pants and raped her. She was then chained in the basement and repeatedly abused. Four days after she was captured, Castro turned on the news and saw her mother pleading for her safe return. She said that a silent Castro watched Louwana Miller beg for her daughter to come home. 'He has an odd look on his face, and then I realize: He's proud,' Amanda wrote about her monstrous captor. She also described in the People interview how Castro was much stronger than he looked, packing muscle beneath his rotund figure. 'To be around him was scary,' Amanda recalled.'He had these cold black eyes. We were afraid we were going to die.' The Cleveland 'house of horrors' survivors have written a book, being published on April 27 . Gina DeJesus was abducted using a similar ploy by Castro a year later. She described her abductor to People as 'always prepared'. It later emerged that Michelle Knight, now 34, had been imprisoned in a separate bedroom since August 2002. A month after learning that her mother, Louwana Miller, had died, Amanda, realized she was pregnant by Castro in April 2006. Although initially elated, she worried how Castro would react. Amanda wrote: 'I think my mom sent me this baby. It's her way of giving me an angel. But I worry about what he's going to do. 'Michelle told me that he beat her to make her miscarry. Will he let me carry my baby?' As the pregnant teen mourned her mother alone amid harrowing torture and abuse, she recalled how she made video tapes of news reports of her mom at vigils and watched them repeatedly. Amanda wrote in the memoir: 'I would rewind and hear her voice. I feel like she's definitely here with me now.' On Christmas Day, she gave birth in her prison of a home to daughter, Jocelyn, with the help of Michelle. Castro appeared delighted to have a new daughter, Amanda wrote. She recalled: 'When the baby started kicking, I reached for his hand and placed it on my stomach. 'I knew the baby would be safer if he was excited about being a new father.' Castro told her that they were 'a family'. The predator took the little girl, whom he called Pretty, to church and out to play while her mother remained in chains in his filthy, dilapidated home. Castro finally took the chains off the three women when Jocelyn started to notice them, even though Amanda tried to protect her daughter by telling her that they were only bracelets. Amanda described her confusion at feeling some warmth towards Castro when he treated their daughter well. She wrote: 'I know it's wrong but I feel closer to him. I appreciate that he treats Jocelyn so well and buys her clothes and toys. 'I desperately want Jocelyn to have a normal life. On the days that he helps me do that, I actually feel some affection for him. I'm so confused. 'How can he be good one minute and so cruel the next?' When Jocelyn was five years old, Amanda set up a kindergarten in their bedroom. Amanda asked Castro to buy books. She recalled how her daughter would sit at her 'Dora' desk while Amanda, acting as teacher, would recite the Pledge of Allegiance with her. In November 2012, Castro was becoming more agitated. He lost his job as a bus driver due to stress and began to wonder how he would be remembered in the newspapers because of what he had done. His daughter Jocelyn began to ask when she could go to a real school. Amanda Berry (pictured left as a teen) along with Gina DeJesus (right) and Michelle Knight were held captive in Ariel Castro's Cleveland, Ohio home for 10 years . The broken front door of the house on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland Ohio where Amanda Berry kicked her way to freedom on May 6, 2013, more than a decade after she went missing . On May 6, 2013, a chance finally arose - Castro forgot to lock the door of her bedroom, and Amanda grabbed her daughter and bolted for the front door, kicking her way out through a bottom panel. Amanda described that heart-pounding break for freedom in an exclusive interview with Robin Roberts for ABC's 20/20 to be aired next Tuesday. She said: 'I didn't know what to do, my heart immediately started pounding because I’m like, ''is-- should I chance it? ... He could be here any minute, if I’m going to do it, I need to do it now.' Following the daring escape, police descended on the home, freeing the other women and arresting Castro. He pleaded guilty in July 2013 to 937 counts including two charges of aggravated murder related to one act of forcing one of his victims to miscarry. The 53-year-old was sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus 1,000 years in August 2013. He hanged himself in his prison cell less than a month into his sentence. Neither Gina nor Amanda is still in touch with fellow survivor Michelle Knight (pictured) but said in an interview that they wished her well for the future . Amanda recalls how mixed she felt when she learned from a text message that he killed himself. But despite being chained and raped for a decade by the monster, Jocelyn was his daughter and the little girl loved him. 'I don't know what to feel,' she wrote of that September night, as tears streamed down her face. Amanda and Gina revealed in their memoir, written with Washington Post journalists Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan, how their captor would play mind games and try to turn them against each other. However they began to establish bonds as they struggled through their darkest hours. Neither Amanda or Gina is currently in touch with fellow survivor Michelle Knight. In People Magazine, Gina said: 'I think we all did like each other at one point but then [Ariel} played us against each other so we couldn't trust people.' Amanda added that the difficulty of their situation was something that only the three women could understand and she wished Michelle the best for the future. The mother said that she was focused on moving forward in life and concentrating on doing the best for her now eight-year-old daughter. Gina, who is studying for her high school diploma, dreams of owning her own business. And both women said what they have been through left them happy, simply for being able to have regular lives, surrounded by their families.

    "article": "While many tattoos hold a certain symbolism to their bearer, the design chosen by someone getting their first ink at the age of 80 must have an incredibly special meaning. ABC2's new show, Tattoo Tales, follows the journey of some of the customers of Bondi Ink, a busy tattoo parlour on Sydney's Eastern beaches, including Jan Bearman, who was prompted by the death of her beloved daughter to make a decision that took the rest of her family and friends by surprise. 'Before I lost my darling Shell I wouldn't have dreamed of having a tattoo. But when something like that happens you're left grasping at straws. There's a hole left in your life and all you can do is say your prayers,' Jan told Daily Mail Australia. For the past three years, Jan Bearman has had a new tattoo inked on her shoulder every birthday in memory of her daughter Shell, who died of complications from diabetes in . Jan's daughter Shelley died in 2011 at the age of 56 of complications from her diabetes . 'There were reminders of her all around me, and I decided to get a reminder of her on me,' Jan, now 83, said. When Shelley, who was fondly nicknamed Shell, died in 2011 at the age of 56 from complications of the diabetes she had lived with for nearly all her life, two of Jan's granddaughters and Shell's husband decided to get tattoos in memory of her. 'And then I just couldn't think of a reason to not get one,' Jan said. 'Shell was just such a gorgeous girl. It's a loss that leaves a hole in your heart that's never filled again. You do these things as a memorial, to carry [her] with you,' she said. Jan said that when she announced her decision to her family, they were quite surprised but supportive the unexpected move from the now 83-year-old. 'I think they were a bit surprised but they didn't say \"don't do it\", they said \"go ahead if it will make you feel better\",' she said. 'I tried to con my other daughter into getting one too but she wasn't having any of it.' Soon after the decision had been made, Jan was spending the day with one of Shell's daughters, when they passed Bondi Ink. 'Shell was just such a gorgeous girl,' said Jan (left) of her eldest daughter, with her other daughter Lisa (right) Jan getting her third tattoo, a shell, by tattoo artist Shaun 'Bones' from Bondi Ink . Jan said that her tattoos are a memorial and a way for her to carry her children with her . 'She popped in and asked if they had a spare moment to chat about getting a tattoo. They asked her \"oh, are you thinking of getting one\", and she said \"no, it's for my grandmother\",' Jan said. 'The man at the counter said \"that's gold\", and it went from there,' she said. For her 80th birthday, Jan had Shell's name inked on her upper arm near her shoulder, along with a cross, and said that she was surprised at how painless it was. 'I was surprised to be honest. I don't know if I'm a bit tough, but it certainly wasn't unbearable,' Jan said. 'There are parts of the body that are easier, and one of those is the arm, which is where I got mine,' she said. The now-83-year-old wasn't done with just the one tattoo, and continued coming back to the studio each year for another tattoo to commemorate her daughter, tattooing the initials of her three children above the cross on her second run. In the second episode of Tattoo Tales, Jan gets her third tattoo- a beautiful coloured shell below her daughter's name. 'Nobody sees it but me, it's just my family who knows and the friends I've mentioned it to,' Jan said. Jan got a shell as her third tattoo, in memory of her daughter Shelley, who was nicknamed Shell . 'I don't know if I'm a bit tough, but [the pain] certainly wasn't unbearable,' Jan said of her experience in the chair . Jan with her daughter and granddaughters at one of their 'girls lunches' in Sydney . 'Shell didn't have any tattoos but I'd like to think she'd have a smile to herself if she saw them on me,' she said. Jan said that she used to not be a fan of tattoos, but that now she doesn't assume that people are different simply because they are inked. 'I'd be a hypocrite if I did. I don't hold anything different against them, although I do worry when I see young girls with tattoos all over them that they'll go through life and get older and be sorry they got so many,' she said. Jan is unsure whether she will continue to go back for more tattoos on her birthday as has become the tradition. The owner of Bondi Ink, John, said that this year's tattoo was his 'birthday present' to Jan, and insisted she come back for her gift next year. 'He always gives me a big hug, and says \"see you next year\",' she said. Jan said that the restaurant where she has her birthday lunch each year is right across the road from Bondi Ink, which may prove tempting. 'I think I've done my dash. The birthday lunch get-togethers are always so nice though, so maybe I will get another one later,' she said. Jan features in episode two of Tattoo Tales which airs on ABC2 on Wednesday April 9 at 9.40pm. Episode Two of Tattoo Tales airs on ABC2 on Wednesday April 9 at 9.40pm .",

    "article": "Ricky Woolaston, 35, dressed in uniform bearing the University of Birmingham logo to break into students' houses and steal laptops . A thief who tricked his way into students' homes to steal their belongings was caught when he left his old police charge sheet behind which had his name written on it. Ricky Woolaston, 35, posed as a university maintenance engineer to gain access to students' properties before pinching laptops and mobile phones to feed his drug habit. But a court heard he was easily tracked down by police after he left behind his bag at the scene of one of the crimes. Officers searched the rucksack and found it contained a police charge sheet from a previous offence bearing his name and address. The prolific thief was arrested last Friday, and has now been sentenced to four years in prison at Birmingham Crown Court after pleading guilty to five burglaries. The court heard unemployed Woolaston would walk around the University of Birmingham campus wearing clothes bearing the red-brick university's logo. But he was caught out when he broke into the Biosciences Department on January 29 where he forced open two secure metal cupboards. Nothing was stolen but Woolaston, from Erdington, Birmingham, left behind the bag containing the charge sheet. Police were then able to pin four other burglaries on him with the help of students who  positively identified him. After the case, Detective Constable Jon Green, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Woolaston targeted students at Birmingham University in order to feed his drug habit. However, Woolaston was caught after breaking into the University's bio-sciences lab and leaving behind a bag containing a previous police charge sheet, with his name and address written on it . 'He wore a University of Birmingham top and pretended to be a maintenance engineer in order to enter the student flats and steal electrical goods. 'Unfortunately for him, Woolaston managed to leave vital evidence behind at one of the break-ins, and we are grateful to vigilant students who were able to identify him for further burglaries. 'Woolaston was charged with a total of five offences, and asked for a further five burglaries to be taken into consideration. We are happy with his sentence.'",

    "article": "Xiao Zhengti, five, was born with a congenital liver disease meaning he needed his first transplant at just nine months old . A boy in China born with a malfunctioning liver is now looking forward to living a normal life after both of his parents donated part of their organs to save him. Xiao Zhengti, now five, was born with a  liver condition meaning he had to have his first major surgery at just nine months old, when mother Yang Haiying donated part of her liver, The People's Daily Online reports. But the boy's body rejected the organ, leading to years of trips to hospital, until father Xiao Kunqing was allowed to donate 40 per cent of his liver yesterday, leading to a full recovery. The touching story began in 2009 shortly after Xiao was born to parents from southern China's Hunan province with jaundice, which is common in babies, but doctors became concerned after it did not dissipate within a few weeks. Soon his parents noticed that he had a strange looking bulge in his stomach, and after visits to specialist Guangdong and Shanghai he was diagnosed with congenital biliary atresia. The rare condition occurs where the bile ducts around the liver swell during or immediately after birth, which can cause the tissue around them to scar. While the exact cause of bilairy artesia is unknown, it is usually fatal if left untreated, and in severe cases, such as Xiao's, it may require a transplant. The initial operation took place just nine months after he was born, but complications followed and his body rejected his mother's liver. Mother Yang Haiying (right) first donated a portion of her liver to try and save her son after being found to be a match, but his body rejected it, leading to to repeated trips to hospital for the next four years . Father Xiao Kunqing (left) was also found to be a match for the boy, but surgeons warned against a second operation, saying it carried far greater risks . However doctors eventually relented, and yesterday Mr Kunqing had 40 per cent of his liver removed and transplanted into his son . A year after the first transplant Xiao suffered 200 days of high fever, and spent the next four years moving in and out of hospital. But yesterday at the hospital in Tianjin City, eastern China, surgeons agreed to try a second operation after father Xiao Kunqing offered to donate 40 per cent of his liver. Dr Dong Chong, head of the transplant unit in Tianjin, warned the second operation would be more difficult than the first, and would carry greater risks, but the parents were determined to go ahead. The operation began at 8am on Thursday April 16th, with Mr Kunqing moved to the recovery room at around 4pm after having his liver removed. By 7.30pm Xiao Zhengti’s operation was successfully completed, and he was also moved to recovery. The operation is believed to be the first ever in China where two parents have donated the same organ in order to save their child. Surgeons now say that the operation, which took five hours to complete, was a complete success and they expect Xiao to be home within weeks when he can begin living a normal life . Medics say the operation is believe to be the first in China where two parents have donated the same organ in order to save their child . Dr Dong Chong, head of the transplant unit in Tianjin City, where the operation took place, said he expects Xiao to be home in three weeks and to lead a full and active life . Dr Dong told reporters 'The operation was extremely successful and went according to plan. 'We used microscopes for the intricate operation which normally would have taken just 2 hours but this one took 5. However it was very successful.' He added that he expects Xiao Zhengti to make a full recovery and leave hospital in around 3 weeks to enjoy a happy and active life.",

    "article": "Radamel Falcao has been having a tough time of it on the pitch in recent months, but the struggling striker will have benefited from some much-needed perspective after spending Thursday evening in the company of Jonas Gutierrez. Newcastle United defender Gutierrez, who successful underwent treatment for testicular cancer earlier this year, was given a standing ovation at Anfield when he was introduced as a second-half substitute during his side's 2-0 defeat by Liverpool on Monday night. Falcao managed to catch up with Gutierrez and posted a picture of the pair on his Instagram account stating: 'It was a pleasure to spend time with @elgalgojonas ,a great example of bravery and a great person'. Radamel Falcao (right) spent his Thursday evening in the company of Jonas Gutierrez . Manchester United striker Falcao walks through Alderley Edge in Cheshire on Thursday afternoon . The on-loan forward has been linked with Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus and Valencia in recent weeks . Falcao replaced Marouane Fellaini in the 83rd minute during United's 4-2 rout of Manchester City . The Colombia striker moved to Old Trafford on a season-long loan from Monaco last summer but has struggled to hit the heights he achieved before suffering a serious knee injury. United will have to pay £46million to make Falcao's transfer permanent but, having only scored four goals all season in 22 appearances for the club, his future with Louis van Gaal's side is looking increasingly uncertain. The former Atletico Madrid striker is currently commanding £280,000 a week in wages and had to suffer the ignominy of playing for United's Under 21 team in March. Liverpool are being linked with the 29-year-old forward but it is understood that Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus and Valencia are more likely destinations.

    "article": "A teddy bear mascot owned by a celebrated Battle of Britain fighter pilot who carried it in his Spitfire cockpit has gone on sale for £10,000. Flight Lieutenant Stephen Beaumont took his cherished bear with him on every Spitfire and Defiant flight he took to defend Britain from the aerial onslaught from Hitler's Luftwaffe. The pilot gave his teddy, named Beaumont Bear, a RAF tie and printed the Royal crest, the letters AM for Air Ministry and his nickname 'Bea' on his chest. Flight Lieutenant Stephen Beaumont took his treasured teddy bear mascot on every flight, pictured together in the cockpit of a Boulton Paul Defiant . Fl Lt Beaumont was one of just seven of the 24 pilots in his squadron who survived the 1940 Second World War battle and believed his beloved teddy bear brought him luck. He was known as one of 'The Few', which comes from Winston Churchill's famous phrase: 'Never, in the field of human conflict, was so much owed by so many to so few.' When Fl Lt Beaumont died aged 87 in 1997, his bear - suffering from a little wear and tear - was passed to his family. It is now being tipped to sell for an estimated £10,000 when it goes under the hammer at Bonhams auctioneers on behalf of a private collector. The teddy, named Beaumont Bear (left), is expected to sell for £10,000 when it goes under the hammer at Bonhams. Fl Lt Beaumont's uniform (right) is also up for sale for £2,000 . Tom Lamb, a specialist in military history at Bonhams, said: 'The life of an RAF pilot in the Summer of 1940 was marked by great physical danger and mental strain. 'Of the 3,000 airmen who served in this period, over one sixth were killed in combat. 'Teddy bears became popular mascots and helped to bolster the resolve of men engaged in a conflict where survival seemed a matter of luck as much as of skill. 'This particular bear called Beaumont Bear once belonged to Flight Lieutenant Stephen Beaumont, a 30-year old Spitfire pilot in the Battle of Britain. 'He flew numerous sorties with the bear in his cockpit. 'Flight Lieutenant Beaumont survived the war and died at the age of 87. His bear has lived on and if it could speak it surely would have some amazing stories of dog fights, sorties and close shaves. 'If it were just a normal bear it would be almost worthless but this one could go . Fl Lt Beaumont was aged 30 when his Squadron Commander, 26-year-old George Darley, removed him from combat duties midway through the Battle of Britain because of his 'advancing age'. Beaumont, a solicitor before the war, was furious at the time. The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF, pictured is a German Messerschmitt 109 shot down in raids over Ramsgate . He became an instructor, teaching young pilots the skills they would need to fly Spitfires and Hurricanes in dogfights against the Luftwaffe. He quickly rose through the ranks to the Wing Commander before helping plan the aerial assault aspect of the D-Day invasions. In 1945 he Beaumont was honoured for his outstanding contribution to the war effort by being made an OBE. Mr Lamb said: 'The teddy bear followed Beaumont in his new duties as an instructor and flight commander at an Operational Training Unit. 'There he distinguished himself in training Hurricane and Spitfire pilots, before eventually assisting in the preparations for D-Day in the role of Deputy Air Officer Administration.' After the war Fl Lt Beaumont, who was a solicitor before the war and was educated at Oxford University, returned to his home town of Wakefielfd, West Yorks, and took a string of administrative roles including becoming the city's deputy coroner. In 1967 he was appointed Deputy Lieutenant for the West Riding of Yorkshire, and in 1979 High Sheriff of West Yorkshire. He retired to Devizes, Wilts. His teddy is being auctioned on April 29 in New York. Fl Lt Beaumont's uniform is also up for sale, for £2,000. The Battle of Britain was one of the turning points of the Second World War and prevented Germany from invading Britain . The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF from July to September 1940. It was one of the turning points of the Second World War and prevented Germany from invading Britain. The battle began in mid-July with Luftwaffe concentrating on attacking shipping in the English Channel and attacking coastal towns and defences. From 12 August, Hermann Goering, one of the leaders of the Nazi regime, shifted his focus to the destruction of the RAF, attacking airfields and radar bases. (Pictured above, RAF scrambling to their planes in 1940.) Convinced that Fighter Command was now close to defeat, he also tried to force air battles between fighter planes to break British strength. However, Goering grew frustrated by the large number of British planes that were still fighting off his attacks. Luftwaffe switched tactics again and, on Hitler's orders, set about destroying London and other major cities. Eleven days later, on what became 'Battle of Britain Day', the RAF decimated the huge incoming Luftwaffe formations in the skies above London and the south coast.",
